## 2026-09-04 — Unified File & Lead counting rule across all reports
- Rule: A File is counted ONLY by `file_created_at` (fallback `created_at`); a Lead ONLY by `lead_created_at` (fallback `updated_at`). Counted by the day it BECAME that status, never last-edit/import date.
- Applied consistently to: Dashboard status-breakdown + KPIs (reports.py get_dashboard_stats, admin+GP branches), Reports Summary (/reports/telecallers overall), Hourly (/reports/hourly), My-Hourly, Daily Tracking (/reports/daily-tracking-sheet), Manager Team Stats.
- File attribution is now ALIAS-AWARE (utils.hierarchy UserIndex): owners referenced by legacy/duplicate ids resolve to the canonical person, so no file is dropped. Counts include files owned by any user (admin/legacy) so totals match the global Summary. Empty rows suppressed.
- leads.py update_lead now stamps `lead_created_at` when status first becomes leads/converted (mirrors file_created_at stamping at leads.py:739/994).
- Fallback design => today's numbers unchanged; fix only freezes dates against future edits + makes all reports consistent.
- Call Log (/api/reports/detailed-calls) confirmed working (dual lead_oid + lead_uuid $lookup).
- Verified in preview: Dashboard == Summary == Hourly == Daily Tracking File totals for a given date.
- NOTE: preview DB != production DB; production carries today's live data. Deployed to production for real verification.
